Directions and materials for Turing student code fairs

### Initial Form Data Cleanup
 - [ ] Standardize module field (cohort number vs module number, B/FEE vs B/FE, etc.)
 - [ ] Standardize names wrt groups & capitalization
 - [ ] Shorten all project descriptions to a standard format (ie, "*Project name or short description of functionality* w/ *associated languages/libraries*")
 - [ ] If a Posse signed up as a single student, change the name to the name of the Posse

### Recommendations for Organizing Presenters
 - [ ] Colocate projects with the same presenter (ie, Posse members with personal projects)
 - [ ] Group presenters by cohort (though this was up for debate in SAB, so maybe try a random assortment next time around and see which is preferable)
 - [ ] Consider assigning group projects to larger tables
